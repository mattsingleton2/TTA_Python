 My Python Projects while learning at the Tech Academy

 ## text_game.py
This is a quick little text game that just shows variable handling in a text game format.

## directoryParseChallenge.py
The goal here was to write a quick script that looked in an absolute file path, iterated through all the files
within, and then only displayed the filename and modification time for any TEXT files within. 

## file_input_output_practice.py
As the file name would mention, I used this file to do a little practice with manipulating files using the os import. 
There seems to be a lot of untapped potential here for me. Already chewing on how I can use this to automate some reporting
tasks in the mornings for my current job and make those happen for me in the background! Can't wait to get a Python repo
up and start displaying some practice there.
